modified ETOF-K algorithm

v2.0 ：
（1）The problem of node ID discontinuity in data graph is solved.
（2）It finds and solves the problem of dynamic memory reclamation.
（3）Add processing to the pattern graph with a single pattern edge;
（4）The program is modified for multiple source node (pattern_graph_new02) pattern graph processing.


The enumeration is pruned to return only one result per leader.
